# ScrollWatch

jQuery plugin for determining active sections on the page based on scrolling.

[Demo](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://github.com/ShiraNai7/jquery-scrollwatch/blob/master/demo.html)


## Features

- determining active section(s)
- mapping active class to a list of elements (e.g. menu items)
- many options, including multiple modes of resolution
- works with zoom (even in MSIE < 9)


## Browser support

Tested in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, Opera and MSIE 7+.


## Usage

The plugin provides two jQuery methods you can use:


### $(sections).scrollWatch(callback[, options])

Attaches a watcher to the given sections. The callback is then invoked when the focus
changes, according to options.

**Warning:** if the sections are inside a custom scrollable element, that element **must** have `position: relative`, `absolute` or `fixed`.

- **sections** - selector or an array of elements that represent all the possible sections
- **callback** - function to invoke when the focus changes
- **options** - object with various settings (see list far below)

**Returns:** an instance of `Shira.ScrollWatch.Watcher` or `false` if no sections were given / matched.


#### Callback arguments

- **0** - the current focus, an object with the following keys (if **resolutionMode** is **none**, it will be an array of those objects):
    - **index** - section number (0 based)
    - **intersection** - null or an array with top coordinate as element 0 and bottom coordinate as element 1
    - **section** - DOM element of the section
- **1** - the current view, an object with the following keys:
    - **top** - top coordinate of the view
    - **bottom** - bottom coordinate of the view
- **2** - an instance of `Shira.ScrollWatch.Watcher`


#### Example:

    $(function () {
        $('div.section').scrollWatch(function (focus) {
            console.log(focus);
        });
    });


### $(sections).scrollWatchMapTo(items[, activeClass, options])

Attaches a watcher to the given sections and maps the current focus as an "active class"
to the respective item.

**Warning:** if the sections are inside a custom scrollable element, that element **must** have `position: relative`, `absolute` or `fixed`.

- **sections** - selector or an array of elements that represent all the possible sections
- **items** - selector or an array of elements to map the "active class" to
- **activeClass** - class name to add to the active item (defaults to "active")
- **options** - object with various settings (see list far below)

**Returns:** an instance of `Shira.ScrollWatch.Watcher` or `false` if no sections were given / matched.


#### Example:

    $(function () {
        $('div.section').scrollWatchMapTo('#menu > li');
    });


### Options
